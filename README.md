## Introduce
Running on bytecode, simple and useless program language, zero dependence script language
Remove all main branch's backend, rewriting with bytecode
## Usage

not write interface yet, unit tests have some examples

```Rust
a = 1
b = 'abc'
println(b)
a = false
if a {
    println('dfsdf')
}
println(b)
```

```
abc
abc
```
